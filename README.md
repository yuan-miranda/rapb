### Remote Access Power Brick (RAPB)
Control whether or not the power brick is connected in an outlet remotely via sending serial command from laptop to the microcontroller (Arduino Nano).

> rapb.ino  is the source code for the microcontroller(Arduino Nano)

> rapb.py   is the Python source code used to send serial data to communicate with Arduino

## NOTICE
- As of now, in the lastest modification of the source code, this is still on the debugging stage. The pins for relay module, additional logic, etc,. will be updated when the material arrive

- Majority of the code is generated by ChatGPT, but ive configured and modified it.
